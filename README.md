## Design

The website is based on the Editorial template from HTML5 UP, with colour, typography, navigation and layout tweaks.

## Document structure

Documents should adhere to the following structure for the body:

```
<body>
|
└─ <nav> for navigation menu
│ 
└─ <div id="main"> for main content
   │
   └─ <div id="inner"> for inner content (whitespace)
```

Use `<section class="article">` for further insetting article/post content.
